# PySpark in Azure

Create a HDInsight storage container and cluster. The cluster will allow us to run Jupyter notebook which will then utilize kernals provided by HDInsight to run PySpark applications.

Files will be stored in a separate container within Azure and the output of the parquet files will be stored in the HDInsight storage container under csv_folder and json_folder.
